Bad Ads- Testing AI models against visual prompt injections/ fake malicious ads 

note: to run the code open it in colaboratory and run the cells, you can download the zip below of all the ads,websites if you'd like!

zip is here! https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RjsIqiDIkMSqJulD9d7EPsaCCN6qJQjH/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N7hXWRVCo718_EzKEh9W09sAiXmsQnDu/view?usp=sharing

github doesnt "really" allow files over 50mb

Basically i showed you can hijack an ai (like agent) via ads on a site; much more malicious if something like  full time operator came out

works best on model with learn vision rather than something like OCR- as the text isnt too common.
